# Stock Analysis using VBA and Excel

## Overview of the Project
### Purpose
For this project we analyzed, edited, and refactored the Stock Market Dataset using VBA solution code to move through the data one time to collect a dataset. Utilizing our first set of subroutines we can determine the speed in which our programs sorted the data and provided us the information we requested. After we acquired this information, we refactored our code to determine if we could make it work a little more efficiently. Finally streamlining our code to make it easier for future users.
