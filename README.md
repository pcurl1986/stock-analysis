# Stock Analysis using VBA and Excel

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose

For this project we analyzed, edited, and refactored the Stock Market Dataset using VBA solution code to move through all the data at one time to collect our dataset. Utilizing our first set of subroutines we can determine the speed in which our programs sorted the data and provided us the information we requested. After we acquired this information, we refactored our code to determine if we could make it work more efficiently. We finished by streamlining our code to make it easier for future users.

## Results

After refactoring our code we achieved a measurable difference in the speed or efficiency of our code. Our code outputs the Total Daily Volume and the return on each of our 12 ticker categories.

### Analysis and Challenges

I began by adding the instructions that were needed to create the input box, chart headers, ticker array, and activate the appropriate worksheet. The steps were then listed out in order to define the structure for the refactoring. This allowed me to take the original code that I wrote for the module's homework and insert a step by step guide to my restructure. Below is the instruction and code as written in the file.

## Summary

After we analyzed our data using our initial code, we refactored our code to make it more easily read and decrease the run time. The result was that the spreadsheet could be annalyzed in less than 1 second. Below are the images to illustrate the gains achieved after refactoring.
