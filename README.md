# Stock Analysis using VBA and Excel

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose

For this project we analyzed, edited, and refactored the Stock Market Dataset using VBA solution code to move through the data one time to collect a dataset. Utilizing our first set of subroutines we can determine the speed in which our programs sorted the data and provided us the information we requested. After we acquired this information, we refactored our code to determine if we could make it work a little more efficiently. Finally streamlining our code to make it easier for future users.
## Results

After refactoring we got a noticeable difference in the speed and cleanliness in the runtime of our code. We see our Total Daily Volume and return on our 12 ticker categories.

### Analysis and Challenges

I began by copying the code that was needed to create the input box, chart headers, ticker array, and to activate the appropriate worksheet. The steps were then listed out in order to set the structure for the refactoring. So this allowed me to take my original code that I worked on during the module homework and do a step by step on my restructure. Below is the instruction and code as written in the file.
